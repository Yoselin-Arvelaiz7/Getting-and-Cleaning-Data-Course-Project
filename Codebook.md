# Variables

1. x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
2. train and test merge the previous datasets to further analysis. And merge the training and testing data into Dataset
3. features contains the correct names for the Dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in m_s, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
4. A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
5. Finally, TidyData contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file.
